## Websites I Recommend

* [Cool Math Games](https://www.coolmathgames.com/) - Thinking of websites I visit often or would recommend, other than Google, was hard. But throughout my childhood, I would say that Cool Math Games was probably the site I visited the most. It is a collection of multiple games in one place.
